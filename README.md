# Gesture-Volume-Control
Volume Control using OpenCV

Here i made volume control using Python and OpenCV in which we can control the volume of our laptop/pc using our fingers

This HandTrackingModule contains functions that will help in detecting our hands and fingers and also detecting which fingers are up

Modules that i have used are

1) Ctype-ctypes is a foreign function library for Python. It provides C compatible data types, and allows calling functions in DLLs or shared libraries.

2) Comtypes- It is a lightweight Python COM package, based on the ctypes FFI library. It allows to define, call, and implement custom and dispatch-based COM interfaces in pure Python

3) PyCaw- It's a Python Core Audio Windows Library
